# MinecraftServerAutomation
Project to add automation to my Minecraft server in tasks such as shutdown, backup, and startup.

This project targets a minecraft server running on a windows machine.

ToDo:
- [ ] Look into alternative to the pyautoit module(possibly pywinauto) or contribute to pyautoit
- [ ] Create startup script
- [ ] Have backup script delete old backups

# MinecraftServerAutomation
Project to add automation to my Minecraft server in tasks such as shutdown, backup, and startup.

This project targets a minecraft server running on a windows machine.

ToDo:
- [ ] Look into alternative to the pyautoit module(possibly pywinauto) or contribute to pyautoit(https://github.com/jacexh/pyautoit)
- [ ] Create startup script
- [x] Have backup script delete old backups
